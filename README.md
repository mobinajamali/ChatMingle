# ChatMingle
Telegram Bot for connecting strangers together give them the ability to chat. I used my previous work [Telegram_Bot_Template](https://github.com/mobinajamali/Telegram_Bot_Template) as a template for this project.
*This project was inspired from Pytopia.

## How to Run
1. Use the following command to set your telegram bot token as environment variable. You can request it from @BotFather `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`:
```
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_telegram_bot_token>
```

2. Clone this repository and export `PYTHONPATH`:
```
PYTHONPATH=${PWD}
```

3. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
python src/run.py

```
